# 👋 Hello There!

Currently a student (in summer break) who is studying more code...*once in a while*.

## Enjoys

- 🧹 Learning about clean code,
- ✏️ Learning about ways to refactor code,
- 💭 Pondering about problems I'm having difficulty with,
- ♻️ Thinking about code architecture and how clean, maintainable software is written, and...
- 🖥️ Coding, most of all!
